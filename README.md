# Figure-8-Mechanism
This is the design of a figure 8 mechanical synthesiser. The Design explores the use of Forrier Series to generate these designs. 

The report analyzes different approaches to designing the Figure 8 synthesiser (lemiscate of gerono). The final conclusion being that a Fourier
series of linkage length and respective angles will provide the easiest method of design, however come with limited resolution. 

The Matlab files are to be placed in the same directory and main8.m is to be run. This will generate what the mechanism would draw if it were
built.
